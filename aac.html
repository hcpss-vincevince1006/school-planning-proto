  <h1>Attendance Area Committee (AAC) Process</h1>
</div>

<p class="post__paragraph--callout">When redistricting is planned, the attendance areas adjustment process for the HCPSS begins in the spring with the appointment of the Attendance Area Committee (AAC) by the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The AAC reviews and comments on the attendance area plans. The AAC also reviews and comments on the current capital budget and Capital Improvement Plan in conjunction with anticipated redistricting. The AAC's input is taken into consideration when developing the Superintendent's Attendance Area Adjustment Recommendation.</p>
