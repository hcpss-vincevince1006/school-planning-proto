  <p class="post__paragraph--callout">To ensure school capacities are balanced based on growth in Howard County's population and added school infrastructure, the Office of School Planning facilitates the redistricting process once it's been recommended by the Board of Education. </p>
  <p>Redistricting can be recommended by the Board of Education based on a few scenarios:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>new school opening</strong> in the district</li>
      <li>The need for adjustments <strong>to balance enrollment numbers</strong> across school attendance areas or improve upon existing school feeds</li>
      <li>Accommodate for <strong>new students</strong> as a result of rapid population growth in Howard County</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>2018-19 Planned Redistricting - Opening of Elementary School #42</h2>
  <p>No redistricting was recommended for the 2016-17 school year.</p>
  <p>Long range redistricting plans were presented in the Feasibility Study in June 2016. The next scheduled redistricting will go into effect at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year in order to accommodate the opening of new Elementary School #42. <strong>The planning process will begin in May 2017.</strong></p>
